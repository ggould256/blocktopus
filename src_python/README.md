Package Root
============

This is the top-level directory of the python package provided by this repository.
It should have subdirectories for each module provided by the package.

It is a violation of "src layout" conventions for this directory to contain any
files.  We do not obey that rule.  Rather, this directory contains files like
this one that are:
 * not source code, and
 * influence all modules within the package
